HW Code from my CSE 214 CourseWork

This is the layout of the descriptions of the java programs listed in this branch:

CSE214-HW1 
Runs a LunchLine Stimulator with different "realities" (dealing with different/mulitiple queues and functions to mutate
the studentLine.

CSE214-HW2 
Runs a OilChangeManage that implements a LinkedList that holds a Car Object with properites that can merge said Car-List as well
(Cursor placement changes, and removing elements from LinkedList. This has a cycling with time periods for user to change the Lists as he/she likes,

CSE214-HW3 
Runs a MailRoomManager that implements Stacks to demostrate add,remove,display,print,and empty Mailroom "Stack" Piles.

CSE214-HW4 
Runs a Amusement Park Program that implements queues as Rollar Coaster Ride Waiting Lines (One for VirtualLine Holders, HoldingQueue,
and peopleOnRide) these hold person Objects with cycling through a duration of time.

CSE214-HW5 
Runs "a FXComponentTree which will serve as the tree manager and holds references into a tree (the root and cursor), 
as well as be able to generate and save the tree to and from a file. Again, defining some custom exceptions may be helpful for code readability." 

CSE214-HW6 
Runs a CourseNameComparator that allows us to compare two course names with the following priority: department and then number. 
The CourseNameComparator class also implements the Comparator interface and override the compare method. Funcitionality includes save states and
preloaded files, and add/drop class, and view system of user (as a student) sorted via the course or semester.

CSE214-HW7 
Runs "a RoadCalculator. You will be building a graph of Nodes	and Edges by calling the BigData class from within your buildGraph method.
Next,  will use the information contained within your graph to build the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). You will be able to take in input 
in the form of two strings from the user (source city and destination city) and use Djikstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path between
their two corresponding Nodes."

Scrimish 
Runs a game that involves cards, and specific functionality to each one (special ability, attack value, counters) and 
is based on initial randomised deck and a computer generated player move on move system. (print info function to display more)
